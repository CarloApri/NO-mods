/// Rewired persists the player's bindings keyed by numeric action id, so an id that shifts between
/// sessions silently reassigns whatever the user bound. Allocating with "highest existing id + 1" —
/// the recipe most Nuclear Option mods inherited from TargetCamControl — does exactly that: the
/// number depends on plugin load order, so installing or removing an unrelated mod can hand our id
/// to someone else's action.
///
/// Deriving the id from the action name instead makes it stable forever, independent of load order
/// and of which other mods are present. Collisions become a birthday problem over the range rather
/// than a near-certainty, and the caller falls back to sequential allocation if the slot is taken.
