## YawOnMouse

Copyright (c) 2024 Muj — MIT License

The Rewired action registration in both mods (`Patches/RewiredAwakePatches.cs`) is adapted from
YawOnMouse, which is also the structural reference for the project layout. HeliBinds' per-aircraft
JSON config follows the same general approach as YawOnMouse's aircraft whitelist, though its roster
source, matching and defaults are implemented differently.

## TargetCamControl

by 9138noms — https://github.com/9138noms/TargetCamControl

The technique of injecting user-assignable `InputAction` entries into Rewired's user data before the
input manager reads it originates here; YawOnMouse credits it as the source of its own
implementation, and this repository inherits it through that adaptation.

No code was taken from TargetCamControl directly, and its license terms have not been reviewed. This
notice is attribution for the technique. If its author objects to the credit or wishes it worded
differently, please open an issue.
